        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that
          tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be
          as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
          consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or
          mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a
          certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
          connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
        </p>
        <h4>HTML basically divides as two parts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>HyperText</b>
            <p>
              : It refers to the links that connects the web pages to one
              another, either within a single website or between the websites
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Markup</b>
            <p>
              : It is as to use better text formatting and best way to provide
              the structure to webpage. It includes elements,img,text etc.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Anatomy of an HTML element</h4>
        <article>
          The anatomy of an element is:

          <b>The opening tag</b>: This consists of the name of the element (in
          this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle
          brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to
          take effect. <b>The content</b>: This is the content of the element.

          <b>The closing tag</b>: This is the same as the opening tag, except
          that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks
          where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common
          beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
          <h5>
            The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the
            closing tag.
          </h5>
        </article>
        <b>Nested element:</b> elements inside one into another. For Example
        <pre>
            <code>
          &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong &gt;cat&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <b>Void Emelemts</b> consists a single tag and used to embed/inset
        something into the document. Example as
        <pre>
            <code>
          &lt;img src="..." /&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          <b>Attributes </b> contain extra information about the elements that
          won't appear in the content. For example as class, id, alt, href, src,
          width, height, id and boolean attribute as disabled. We can use single
          or double both quotes for attributes.
